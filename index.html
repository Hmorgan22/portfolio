              <h2>Number Guessing Game</h2>
              <p class="description">
                This project is a number guessing game. The game will randomly
                generate a number between 1 and 20 when the game starts. The
                player will then have a score of 20 points and each incorrect
                guess of the number will subtract 1 point. This game will also
                tell the player if their guess is too high or too low depending
                on the secret number and the players guess. Once the player
                guesses the correct number the screen will change colors check
                if the player score in a new highscore.
